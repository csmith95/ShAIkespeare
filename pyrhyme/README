    pyrhyme is a python library for rhyming words.
    
    Usage is pretty straightforward:
    
        from rhyme import rhymes_with
        words = rhymes_with('space')
        
    Or from the command line:
    
        ./rhyme.py space

    
    * Based on the dictionary data from Brian Langenberger's rhyming
      dictionary:

    * Prononunciations are originally from the CMU phonetic dictionary:
